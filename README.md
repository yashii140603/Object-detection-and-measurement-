# Object-detection-and-measurement-
This project implements a simple method for object detection and measurement using OpenCV. It detects objects in an image, calculates their dimensions, and annotates them with bounding boxes and labels.
📌 How It Works
1️⃣ Converts the image to grayscale and applies Gaussian blur
2️⃣ Uses thresholding to detect object contours
3️⃣ Identifies the second-largest contour as a reference object
4️⃣ Calculates the pixel-to-centimeter ratio
5️⃣ Measures and annotates objects with bounding boxes & dimension labels

🚀 Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
